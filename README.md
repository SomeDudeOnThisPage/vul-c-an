# Vulcan
#### It's funny because it's written with a c instead of a k :)

So yeah, this is my try on implementing a vulkan renderer in plain
c. I have no idea what I'm doing to be perfectly honest.

## Required Libraries

- GLFW 3.3.4+ (https://www.glfw.org/)
- Vulkan SDK 1.2.182+ (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)

## Setup
1. Install required dependencies somewhere (e.g. `lib`-folder).
2. Edit `CMakeLists.txt` and adjust paths accordingly.
3. Use CMake to build the project.
4. And Badabang! And Badaboom!
